    <h1>Clouser</h1>
    <p>Clouser is a feature in js where an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables</p>
    <p>In JS , once a function completes its execution, any variable that were defined inside the function scope cease to exist. (variable -> new variable creates )</p>
    <p>meaning it retains access to x even after outerFunction has completed its execution.</p>
    <script>
        function outer(){
            let b = 10;
            function inner(){
                let a = 20;
                console.log(a+b);
                console.log(b);
            }
            return inner;
        }
        let inner = outer();
        inner();
